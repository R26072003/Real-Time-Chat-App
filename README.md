      TASK IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

The Pink Chat application is a vibrant and interactive real-time chat platform designed to facilitate seamless communication among users. Built using WebSockets, this application allows users to send and receive messages instantly, creating a dynamic chat experience.

    Design and Color Scheme:
The application features a bright pink color scheme, with a gradient background that transitions from a deep pink to a lighter shade. The use of soft colors enhances the user experience, making the interface visually appealing. The chat container is designed with a semi-transparent background, allowing users to see the gradient while maintaining focus on the chat content.

    Layout:
The layout consists of two main sections: a sidebar and a chat area. The sidebar displays the user profile and a list of active users, while the chat area contains the message history and input field. The sidebar is styled with a dark background to contrast with the chat area, ensuring that users can easily navigate and interact with the application.

    Message Display:
Messages are displayed in bubbles that differentiate between sent and received messages. Sent messages are styled with the primary color, while received messages have a lighter background. This distinction helps users quickly identify the flow of conversation. Each message includes the sender's name and a timestamp, providing context for the conversation.

    User Interaction:
Users can type messages in the input field and send them by clicking the "Send" button or pressing the "Enter" key. The application also features a typing indicator that appears when a user is typing, enhancing the interactive experience. This feature keeps users informed about ongoing conversations, making the chat feel more engaging.

    WebSocket Integration:
The application uses a WebSocket connection to enable real-time communication. When a user sends a message, it is transmitted to the server, which echoes it back to all connected clients. This allows for instant message delivery, creating a fluid chat experience. The WebSocket connection is established upon loading the application, ensuring that users can start chatting immediately.

     Responsiveness:
The Pink Chat application is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. On smaller devices, the layout adjusts to ensure that users can easily access all features without compromising usability. The chat area remains accessible, allowing users to engage in conversations on the go.

In summary, the Pink Chat application combines a vibrant design with functional features to create an engaging chat experience. Its use of WebSockets for real-time communication, along with a user-friendly interface, makes it an ideal platform for users looking to connect and communicate effectively.
